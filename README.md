# Student-Performance-Analysis

For every student, academics plays an important role in their life. Not all students share the same background in life. Some students have the full support of their families, and there are also students whose families lack harmony. Many things can affect a student’s success in the academy. This is an mini project on “Students exam performance analysis with Machine Learning” which examines the performance of the student in the academic using the Machine Learning in Python. 

The dataset in the study concerns of 1000 students. The aim of this project is to analyse the performance of the students. 
We perform Linear Regression; model plays a major role in the prediction of correct data by using particular attributes from entire data to be trained to get the original data so that can be predicted easily.

## Proposed System

1) Data Collection (csv file)
2) Data Pre-Processing & Labelling
3) Machine Learning Algorithm
4) Trained Classifier
5) Predicted Lable

## Results
From the results obtained from the linear regression model, we can conclude that the writing score and reading score is more dependent on math score.
